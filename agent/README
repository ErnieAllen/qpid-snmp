Source and makefiles for qpid-snmp

qpid-snmp is an snmp agent based on the net-snmp libraries. It communicates with a single 
qpid broker and exposes the broker's internal objects (queue, exchange, system, memory, etc.)

Before compiling qpid-snmp, you'll need to have the following packages installed:
- qpid-qmf-devel
- qpid-cpp-client-devel
- net-snmp

To compile:
cd into either the Debug or Release directories and run
make clean
make

The application qpid-snmp should be created in that directory.

To configure:
Before you run, some configuration files need to be in place.
- Place the file MRG-MESSAGING-MIB in ~/.snmp/mibs
  This file is the qpid messaging mib.

- Place the file snmp.conf in ~/.snmp
  This file should contain one line:
		mibs +MRG-MESSAGING-MIB
  
- Place the file qpid010.conf in ~/.snmp
- This file should contain two lines:
		rocommunity public
		rwcommunity private
  These community strings are for use while testing only. You would change them to less obvious strings
  for production.
  
All the above files should be in the git repository that contains the source (and this file).

To run:
usage: qpid-snmp [-D<tokens>] [-f] [-L] [-M] [-H] [-b<broker url>]
	[-c<broker connection options>] [-q<qmfOptions>] [LISTENING ADDRESSES]
	-f      Do not fork() from the calling shell.
	-DTOKEN[,TOKEN,...]
		Turn on debugging output for the given TOKEN(s).
		Without any tokens specified, it defaults to printing
		all the tokens (which is equivalent to the keyword 'ALL').
		You might want to try ALL for extremely verbose output.
		Note: You can't put a space between the -D and the TOKENs.
	-H	Display a list of configuration file directives
		understood by the agent and then exit.
	-M	Run as a normal SNMP Agent instead of an AgentX sub-agent.
	-x ADDRESS	connect to master agent at ADDRESS (default /var/agentx/master).
	-L	Do not open a log file; print all messages to stderr.
	-b	The URL of the broker to monitor. Defaults to localhost:5672.
	-c	Additional options to pass to the broker when connecting.	
	-q	Options to use when connecting through qmf. Defaults to {strict-security:False}[eallen@redhat Release]$ 



For testing, run without forking and as a non-AgentX sub-agent. 
Run in a normal user account (not root).
Use a LISTENING ADDRESS of localhost:1161. Normal snmp upd requests are handled on port 161. 
Since we are testing as a normal user, we can use port 1161. 

./qpid-snmp -f -M -L -b <broker> localhost:1161

If you are running a broker locally, your command line would look like:
./qpid-snmp -f -M -L localhost:1161
In this case, the -b argument is intentionally omitted since 
the default is to look for the broker at localhost:5672.

If all goes well, you will see
[init_smux] bind failed: Permission denied
This is because you are running as a non-root user. No worries here.

To test:
In a separate terminal window, run one of the net-snmp commands. For example:
[user ~]$ snmpget -v2c -c public localhost:1161 qpid010Brokeruptime.0
MRG-MESSAGING-MIB::qpid010BrokerUptime.0 = Timeticks: (16102344) 1 day, 20:43:43.44

Another example:
[user ~]$ snmpwalk -v2c -c public localhost:1161 qpid010ExchangeTable
< a whole slew of info about exchanges>

In the above examples we are using version 2c of snmp.
The "public" community string matches the one specified in ~/.spec/qpid010.conf

Currently (4/28/2012), the net-snmp set commands have not been implemented.
